;;! Purpose: An introduction to programming with simple function definitions.

;;! Instructions:
;;! 1. Read the contents of this file, and fill in [TODO] items that appear
;;!    below.
;;! 2. Do not create, modify or delete any line that begins with ";;!", such
;;!    as these lines. These are markers that we use to segment your file into
;;!    parts to facilitate feedback & grading.
;;! 3. When you submit to Gradescope, please:
;;!    A. Check that what you submitted is what you intended. Submitting the wrong
;;!       version will not be a valid excuse to submit late.
;;!    B. Check the results of the autograders that run immediately and correct any
;;!       issues. You can submit as many times as you want until the deadline; however,
;;!       when enabled, FeedBot will only run on a fixed number of submissions.

;;! Problem 1

;;! Part A

;; Consider the following function:
(define (mystery x y z)
  (string-append (substring x 0 z)
                 (substring y z)
                 (substring y 0 z)
                 (substring x z)))

;; Describe the value that mystery produces when you apply it to two identical
;; arguments for x and y.

;; [TODO] Prose description as a comment.
-Result is a string-type which the 1st z characters are repeated at both the beginning and after the remaining part of the string.

;;! Part B

;; Define appropriately named constants for:
;; - an image of a red circle with radius 10 on top of a blue square with side length 40
;; - the string "WELCOME TO FUNDIES 1!"
;; - your favorite number

;; [TODO] Constant definitions

(define CIRCLE-RADIUS 10)
-(define SQUARE-SIDE 40)
-(define RED-CIRCLE (circle CIRCLE-RADIUS "solid" "red"))
-(define BLUE-SQUARE (square SQUARE-SIDE "solid" "blue"))

-(define WELCOME-MESSAGE "WELCOME TO FUNDIES 1!")

-(define luckynumber 7)


;;! Part C

;; Define a function `greet` that takes as an argument a person's name and returns a string
;; with a greeting to that person.
;; [TODO] Function definition
-(define (greet name)
-  (string-append "Hello, " name "!"))

;;! Part D

;; Interest rates are percentages of money that are paid by banks and other
;; institutions, as a benefit of holding some money. They can be expressed as
;; decimal numbers above 1, i.e., 1.1 could represent an interest rate of 10%.
;;
;; Define a function, `apply-interest` that takes a balance, a yearly interest
;; rate, and returns the balance after a single year.
-(define (apply-interest balance interest-rate)
-  (* balance interest-rate))

;;! Part E

;; Now define a second function, `apply-interest-5` that takes a balance, a
;; yearly interest rate, and returns the balance after 5 years.

-(define (apply-interest-5 balance interest-rate)
-  (apply-interest (apply-interest (apply-interest (apply-interest (apply-interest balance interest-rate) interest-rate) interest-rate) interest-rate) interest-rate))
-((define (apply-interest-5 balance interest-rate)
-  (* balance (expt interest-rate 5)))

;;! Problem 2

;; In western classical music, tones are typically placed on a scale called
;; the twelve-tone scale. We use non-negative integers to refer to each tone.
;; For example 60 refers to the tone called "C" (or the "do" in "do-re-mi")
;; near the middle of a piano, whereas 61 refers to the tone one unit higher.
;; We consider two tones with a gap of a multiple of 12 units between them as
;; equivalent. For example, the tones 0, 60 and 84 are all equivalent: they are
;; all the tone "C". However, tones 60 and 67 are not equivalent.

;;! Part A

;; Define a function called tone-class which consumes a single tone as an
;; argument, and produces its *class*,  which is the smallest non-negative
;; integer that is equivalent to the tone. For example, the class of 60 is 0,
;; the class of 61 is 1, and the class of 0 is 0 itself.

;; Hint: Since there are 12 classes starting with zero, you can calculate the
;; class as the remainder. Try looking for relevant functions in the DrRacket
;; Help Desk.

;; [TODO] Function definition
-(define (tone-class tone))
-  (remainder tone 12))

;;! Part B

;; The distance between two tones is how far apart they are, while keeping
;; equivalence in mind. Since there are 12 tone classes, the maximum distance
;; between any pair of tones is 12. However, there are two distances you can
;; produce, depending on which tone you consider first:

;; - The distance between tones 60 and 63 is either 3 (counting up) or 9
;;   (counting down).
;; - The distance between 60 and 75 is also either 3 or 9.
;; - The distance between 63 and 70 is 5 or 7.

;; Write a function called tone-distance which consumes two tones as arguments,
;; and produces their distance (either distance), as defined above.

;; [TODO] Function definition
-(define (tone-class tone)
-  (remainder tone 12))
-(define (tone-distance tone1 tone2)
-  (let*
-      ((class1 (tone-class tone1))
-         (class2 (tone-class tone2))
-         (upward-dist (remainder (- class2 class1) 12))
-         (downward-dist (- 12 upward-dist)))
-    (min upward-dist downward-dist)))

;;! Part C

;; On a piano keyboard, each class of twelve tones (a.k.a., an octave) are
;; placed in a standard pattern of eight white and five black keys. If you are
;; not familiar with this pattern, here is a picture of a piano keyboard:

;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard#/media/File:Klaviatur-3-en.svg

;; Write a function called keyboard that consumes the height and width
;; of the white keys, and produces an image that looks like a piano octave.
;; The black keys are roughly half the width and about 3/4 the length of the
;; white keys.

;; Note: The picture linked above labels the white keys. Your image does not
;; have to do so.

;; Hint 1: The overlay/align function may be very helpful.

;; Hint 2: You can use "transparent" as a color for a rectangle.

;; [TODO] Function definition
-(define (keyboard white-key-height white-key-width)
-  (define white-key (rectangle white-key-width white-key-height "solid" "white"))
-  (define black-key (rectangle (/ white-key-width 2) (* white-key-height 0.75) "solid" "black"))
-  (define white-keys (beside white-key white-key white-key white-key white-key white-key white-key white-key))
-  (define transparent (rectangle (/ white-key-width 2) (* white-key-height 0.75) "solid" "transparent"))
-  (define black-keys 
-    (beside transparent black-key transparent black-key black-key transperent black-key transparent black-key))
-  (overlay/align "bottom" "left" black-keys white-keys))
-(keyboard 100 50)
